            <h1>Develop<br>without limits</h1>

            <p> Since I was very little I used to enjoy surfing websites and using search engines to answer my
                questions.
                I was amazed at how easy internet makes our lives by connecting computers across different places and
                countries and how easily we can transmit information through World Wide Web. In 19th century, Charles
                Babbage developed the first computing device. Through the 20th century, Analog computers were used to
                meet more sophisticated needs of the people during this time. The idea of a modern computer came along
                in 1936, when Alan Turing wrote a paper about the modern computer and its functionalities. He developed
                a ‘Universal Machine’ which was intended to perform the task of all other machines, it could compute
                almost anything that it was programmed to do. This is how the first programmable device came into
                existence. Modern computers have the ability to compute whatever is instructed to it by programming
                languages. Programming languages carry out instructions for how to computer should function. </p>
